# ArgoCD GitOps Project

This repository serves as a GitOps project managed by ArgoCD for deploying and managing Kubernetes applications. GitOps is a paradigm where the desired state of the infrastructure and applications are defined in Git repositories, and tools like ArgoCD reconcile the cluster state to match the desired state defined in Git.

## Overview

This project leverages ArgoCD to automate the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications. It follows the GitOps methodology, which means all changes to the infrastructure and application configurations are made via Git commits and ArgoCD continuously monitors the Git repository to ensure that the cluster state matches the desired state defined in the repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **argocd**: Contains the ArgoCD Application manifests for deploying and managing Kubernetes applications.
- **infrastructure**: Contains environment-specific configurations and overrides.
- **helm-charts**: Contains Helm charts for deploying applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with managing your Kubernetes applications using ArgoCD, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this Git repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Install ArgoCD**: Install ArgoCD on your Kubernetes cluster. You can find installation instructions in the [ArgoCD documentation](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/).

3. **Configure Applications**: Modify or create ArgoCD Application manifests in the `applications` directory to define the applications you want to deploy and manage.

4. **Sync Applications**: Apply the ArgoCD Application manifests using kubectl to sync the applications with your Kubernetes cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f applications/
    ```

5. **Monitor Applications**: Monitor the status of applications in the ArgoCD UI or using the ArgoCD CLI to ensure they are deployed and running correctly.
